        storm, travelling through the English countryside. As the storm takes 
        a turn for the worst, you are fortunate enough to find an old manor 
        house. You run to the ornate entrance, banging the large iron ring. 
        (creeking) Slowly the doors open, and you enter, but no one else is 
        inside. As you inspect the old dusty entry way, positioned towards you,
         is a large standing mirror. The mirror reveals an impossible sight. 
         Behind you; a black figure, it's form unbearable to behold. 
         It paralyses you in fear, and you feel you eyes grow hot, slowly 
         melting out of the sockets. Blinded, the whispers coalesce: Puny 
         being, your sight is now mine. Play my riddles and you may prolong 
         your existence. Shatter the self you have now lost; release the old 
         one no matter the cost. Manage these without contrival, and might u 
         extend your survival.You stumble away holding back terror, and recall 
         that you saw two doors, one on the left, and one on the right."""
